# Variables

As GLSL is a typed language, any variable in GLSL 

* MUST be declared before its used
* MUST have an associated type

### Declaration

Variables may also be initialized when declared.

```GLSL
int num1 = 5, num2;
int oct_num = 0172, hex_num = 0xAD;
int neg_num = -5;
int unsigned_num1 = 10u, unsigned_num2 = 10U;

float pi = 3.14, momentum;
float flt_literal1 = 3.14f, flt_literal2 = 3.14F, exp_flt_literal3 = 2E-5;

double force;
double dbl_literal1 = 3.14lf, dbl_literal2 = 10.5LF; 

bool alive = true, sick = false;
```
